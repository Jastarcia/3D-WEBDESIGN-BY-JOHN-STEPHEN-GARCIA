        <p class="justify">Greece's military history is long and complicated, featuring many periods of military dominance as well as defeats and
        periods of subjugation by other powers.</p>

        <p class="justify">TThe ancient Greeks were renowned for their powerful armies, particularly those of the city-states of Athens and Sparta.
        The victory of the Greeks over the Persian Empire in the Greco-Persian Wars was largely attributable to the
        contributions made by the Athenian navy and the Spartan hoplites, who earned a reputation for their exemplary discipline
        and valor on the field of battle.</p>

        <p class="justify">During the time of the Hellenistic civilization, the armies led by Alexander the Great were among the most powerful in
        the world. Alexander's conquests brought the Greek empire all the way to India, and his strategies and tactics are still
        studied by military historians to this day. Alexander's conquests extended from Greece to India.</p>

        <p class="justify">The Byzantine Empire, whose capital was located in what is now the Greek island of Greece, was home to a formidable army
        that was successful in fending off multiple invasions carried out by Bulgarian, Turkish, and Arab forces. Greek fire was
        one of the Byzantine military strategies and technologies that gave them a significant advantage on the battlefield. The
        Byzantines also developed other innovative military strategies and technologies.</p>
        <p class="justify">In the 1820s, Greece successfully fought a war of independence against the Ottoman Empire, which had ruled Greece for
        centuries prior to that time. The Greek forces were able to defeat the Ottoman armies and establish Greece as an
        independent nation. Figures such as Theodoros Kolokotronis and Alexandros Ypsilantis were instrumental in leading the
        Greek forces to victory.</p>

        <p class="justify">In the 20th century, Greece was involved in a number of military conflicts, the most notable of which were World Wars I
        and II, as well as the Greco-Turkish War. Greece initially put up a fight against the Nazi invasion during World War II;
        however, the country was eventually occupied and endured significant casualties. During the time immediately following
        World War II, Greece was an active participant in NATO, the Korean War, as well as other wars and conflicts.</p>
