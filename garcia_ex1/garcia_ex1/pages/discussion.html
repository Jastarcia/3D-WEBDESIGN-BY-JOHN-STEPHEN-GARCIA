        <p class="justify">The history of Greece spans over four thousand years, beginning with the early civilizations of the Minoans and the
        Mycenaeans, continuing on to the Classical period with the emergence of Athens as the dominant city-state in the fifth
        century BCE, and finally arriving at the Hellenistic period with the conquests of Alexander the Great and the spread of
        Greek culture throughout the Mediterranean world.</p>

        <p class="justify">During the Bronze Age, the Minoan civilization flourished on the island of Crete, while the Mycenaean civilization
        dominated the Greek mainland. Both of these civilizations were located in Greece. The latter failed around the year 1200
        BCE, marking the beginning of a period of relative instability known as the Greek Dark Ages.</p>

        <p class="justify">City-states began to appear around the eighth century BCE, which coincided with a period of revitalized economic
        expansion and cultural advancement. A series of wars, including the Persian Wars and the Peloponnesian War, broke out in
        the region as a result of the rise of Athens, Sparta, Corinth, and Thebes as the preeminent powers in that area.</p>

        <p class="justify">Athens went through a renaissance in the fields of art, literature, philosophy, and democracy during
          the time period
          known as the Classical period. This was made possible by the leadership of statesmen such as Pericles. The city's
          power,
          on the other hand, began to wane after it was defeated in the Peloponnesian War and then subsequently subjugated by
          the
          Macedonian king Philip II.</p>

          <p class="justify">Alexander the Great, the son of Philip II, was responsible for the greatest expansion of the Greek empire and was
          responsible for the conquest of a significant portion of the known world before his death in 323 BCE. After his death,
          the period that followed saw the establishment of Hellenistic kingdoms in Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor.</p>

            <p class="justify">The Romans were eventually successful in their conquest of Greece, which took place in the second century BCE, and
            Greece was subsequently incorporated into the Roman Empire. In spite of its incorporation into the Roman world, Greek
            culture continued to flourish during the Roman period, and many of the world's most influential works of literature,
            philosophy, and science were written in Greek during this time period.</p>

              <p class="justify">The culture and language of Greece had a significant impact on the development of the Byzantine Empire, which arose in
              the wake of the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. Constantinople served as the seat of the Eastern Orthodox Church,
              which played an important part in the administration of the empire (modern-day Istanbul).</p>

              <p class="justify">Greece finally won its independence from Ottoman rule in the 19th century, after being subjected to it for many
              centuries, and established itself as a constitutional monarchy. During World War II, the country was occupied by Nazi
              Germany; however, it eventually regained its independence and transformed into a republic in the year 1974. Greece is a
              country in Europe that is a member of the European Union and is famous for the natural beauty of its islands as well as
              its rich cultural history.</p>
